I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in [L2S lab](https://l2s.centralesupelec.fr/) in [CentraleSup√©lec University](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en/). I work on the project *Smart in Multiple Sclerosis*, the main objective is to identify the multimodal biomarkers related with multiple sclerosis, in collaboration with the [Paris Brain Institute](https://parisbraininstitute.org/).

I pursued my PhD in Signal and Image Processing Sciences at the lab [IBISC](https://www.ibisc.univ-evry.fr/en/) from [Paris Saclay University](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en) in France, ranked 13th worldwide in [Shanghai 2025 ranking](https://www.shanghairanking.com/news/arwu/2025). I worked on an interdisciplinary project relating deep learning methods and neurology. I developed a full automatic pipeline to improve the expert decision-making and characterise patients suffering from a stroke. I also worked as an Assistant Professor for 3 years, covering statistics, mathematics and Machine Learning courses at [UFR](https://www.univ-evry.fr/universite/organisation/composantes/stockage-des-ufrs/ufr-sciences-fondamentales-et-appliquees.html).

In 2023, I was a visiting researcher at [Unicamp University](https://unicamp.br/en/) in Brazil. 

I got my Master's degree from [Ensimag, Grenoble INP](https://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/en) in Applied and Industrial Mathematics, Data Science in France. My master's thesis was about Few-shot learning for object detection, at the  [AI Vision and Language laboratory, CEA](https://kalisteo.cea.fr/index.php/ai/). 

I did my Bachelor's degree at [Universidad Complutense de Madrid](https://www.ucm.es/) in Mathematical Engineering in Spain. During my Bachelor's, I did an Erasmus semester in [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/), in England, and my undergraduate thesis was Cancer detection using deep learning.
